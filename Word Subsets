You are given two string arrays words1 and words2.

A string b is a subset of string a if every letter in b occurs in a including multiplicity.

For example, "wrr" is a subset of "warrior" but is not a subset of "world".
A string a from words1 is universal if for every string b in words2, b is a subset of a.

Return an array of all the universal strings in words1. You may return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: words1 = ["amazon","apple","facebook","google","leetcode"], words2 = ["e","o"]
Output: ["facebook","google","leetcode"]
Example 2:

Input: words1 = ["amazon","apple","facebook","google","leetcode"], words2 = ["l","e"]
Output: ["apple","google","leetcode"]
