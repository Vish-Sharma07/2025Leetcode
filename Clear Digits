You are given a string s.

Your task is to remove all digits by doing this operation repeatedly:

Delete the first digit and the closest non-digit character to its left.
Return the resulting string after removing all digits.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abc"

Output: "abc"

Explanation:

There is no digit in the string.

Example 2:

Input: s = "cb34"

Output: ""

Explanation:

First, we apply the operation on s[2], and s becomes "c4".

Then we apply the operation on s[1], and s becomes "".

 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 100
s consists only of lowercase English letters and digits.
The input is generated such that it is possible to delete all digits.

// Source Code

class Solution {
public:
    string clearDigits(string s) {
        stack<char> st;
        
        for (char c : s) {
            if (isdigit(c)) {
                if (!st.empty()) st.pop();  // Remove closest non-digit
            } else {
                st.push(c);
            }
        }
        
        string result;
        while (!st.empty()) {
            result += st.top();
            st.pop();
        }
        
        reverse(result.begin(), result.end());
        return result;
    }
};
